# **Usage:**
WWspse.jar is the main launchable file,
but download all of the files because of some issues with a custom font.
Make a shortcut for the .jar file instead of moving the file.

## **Launch on startup:**
Press Windows+R and type *shell:startup*.
Add the *shortcut* for the .jar file into the folder.
